== v-transcoder  

v-transcoder is a manager to provide Video Transcoding as a service.

It works together with two projects yet to come:

v-transcoder-client   (gem)
v-transcoder-node     (rails app)

== How it works?

(1) v-transcoder-client, send information about the transcoding needs

(2) v-transcoder, considers the data and select the best v-transcoder-node to get the job   
				  done, and send all necessary data to the client.

(3) v-transcoder-client, with the information received, it uploads the video to be 
					     transcoded to the selected v-transcoder-node
					
(4) v-transcoder-node, transcodes and send a notification when it's done.

(5) v-transcoder-client, downloads the video_artifacts generated and everything is cleaned up.					
					
== Current Status:
